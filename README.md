## 🔬 Abstract
We propose a hybrid architecture combining **ResNet-18** (feature extractor) and a **Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC)** (classifier). The model achieves **99.23% Recall** with only **18 quantum parameters**, demonstrating potential for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.
